# This markdown is to analyze dN/dS ratios and estimate selection
# This analysis will require PAL2NAL (for converting protein alignment to coding alignement) and PAML (main dNdS analysis tool)

### Fasta files with protein and CDS sequences for defined gene family:
  
```rmes1.prot.fa```
```rmes1.prot.afa```
```rmes1.cds.fa```
```rmes1.prot.tre```
  
##### Instructions for generating protein alignment and tree file are at GFA/MSA_PhylogeneticTree.md

### Software installation

# 1. Download PAL2NAL
```wget http://www.bork.embl.de/pal2nal/distribution/pal2nal.v14.tar.gz```
  
```tar -xzf pal2nal.v14.tar.gz```

# 2. Make executable

```chmod +x pal2nal.pl```

# 3. Add to PATH or use full path

```export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/pal2nal```
